## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The prompt(s) that started this project were the following: 

```
1. How would you structure your Terraform project if you have multiple environments
and use different cloud providers?
2. Write a Terraform script with the below requirements:
    ‚óè Creates a ubuntu aws ec2-instance
    ‚óè Install ansible
    ‚óè Execute an ansible playbook
3. If you have multiple Ubuntu prod instances, How would you monitor them? What would be your monitoring strategy?

```

Therefore, this repository contains Terraform configurations to deploy a monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana on cloud providers such as AWS and GCP.

# üîß Instalation <a name = "install"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
   
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-monitoring.git
     ```

2. **Install Terraform**: If you haven't already, install Terraform on your local machine. You can download Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or use a package manager.

3. **Install Ansible**: If you haven't already, install Ansible on your local machine. You can install Ansible using a package manager or by following the instructions on the [official website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).


# üöÄ How to Test (AWS) <a name = "test"></a>

1. **Set up your AWS credentials**: Set up your AWS Access Key and Secret Key using the following command:
    ```
    aws --configure
    ```

4. **Initialize Terraform**: Navigate to the `environments` directory corresponding to the environment you want to deploy (e.g., `environments/dev` or `environments/prod`) and run the following command to initialize Terraform:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

4. **Review Configuration**: Review the Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, etc.) in the chosen environment directory to ensure they match your requirements.

5. **Run Terraform Plan**: Run the following command to preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

6. **Apply Changes**: If the plan looks good, run the following command to apply the changes and deploy the monitoring infrastructure:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

7. **Verify Deployment**: Once the deployment is complete, verify that Prometheus and Grafana are accessible using the provided URLs.


# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

The deployment on GCP has not been tested thoroughly and may not work as expected. Use it at your own risk. This project has only been tested on AWS.
